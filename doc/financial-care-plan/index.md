- [ ] Request information about any linked accounts, such as for automatic debits, bank-to-bank transfers, or recurring payments.
  
- [ ] Request a login to each provider's app and website. This helps you monitor spending, address liabilities, and flag problems.

Protect your loved one from elder abuse fraud such as:

- [ ] Automatic deductions to a fake provider, such as a "neighborhood handyman" or "healthcare group retainer". 

- [ ] Scheduled payments to a fake service, such as a fake "home security system" or fake "medical insurance plan".

- [ ] Charity donations to a fake organization, such as a fake "religious community" or fake "save the animals" charity.

Work with the person's banks, credit card companies, and other financial institutions:

- [ ] Reduce charitable contributions to what the parent can actually afford under their new reality. If one of the contributions is for their church, then you may want to ask the church leaders to help your loved one stop the automatic donations.

If you discover any unknown transactions or suspicious activity, then you should:

- [ ] Consider strengthening all passwords for the person's online accounts, and make each account use a different password.

- [ ] If the issues are related to the person's credit card, then ask the credit card company to issue new a new credit card with new numbers, and to cancel the old credit card.

- [ ] If the issues are related to the person's bank account, then ask the bank to issue a new bank account with new numbers, and to cancel the old bank account.

- [ ] If the issues are persistent, then consider entirely changing where the person banks, to be even more certain that there's nothing attached to the person's accounts. This is a powerful way to escape scammers.

Confirm everything you find with whomever is the executor of the estate:

- [ ] Ensure the executor has everything needed
  
- [ ] Revisit all the above each year
