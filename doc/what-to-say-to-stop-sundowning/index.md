When you see signs of sundowning like restlessness, the beginnings of agitation, or an increase in
any of their existing dementia symptoms, here is exactly what to say to prevent sundowning and
de-escalade sundowning when it is happening.

## Things to Say to Prevent Sundowning

- [ ] "Could you help me with x?"

- [ ] "Will you keep me company out here?"

- [ ] "Will you try/do x with me?"

- [ ] Something silly: singing the invitation/what you want them to do

- [ ] "Ok we are going x" then simply guide the person outside

## Things to Say to Deescalate Sundowning

Step 1 to try: Ask about the person's basic needs.

- [ ] "Water, snack, bathroom?"

- [ ] "Are you too hot, cold?"

- [ ] "Does something hurt?"

- [ ] "Want to take a nap?"

After each of these things, refer back to the preventing sundowning sayings to engage them in an activity to get them completely off of sundowning.

Step 2 to try: Take the person outside or to a different room

- [ ] "Let's go get some fresh air"

- [ ] "Let's go somewhere else"

- [ ] "Let's go for a walk"

Step 3 to try: Do an independent calming activity.

- [ ] "Let's watch a TV show you like"

- [ ] "Let's turn on some calm music we like"

- [ ] "Let's relax in the quiet for a bit"

Step 4 to try: Give the person space.

- [ ] "Do you want some alone time?"

- [ ] "Do you want time for yourself?"

- [ ] "I'll give you a little bit to calm down, I'll be back in 10 minutes"
  
Step 5 to try: Call the doctor or nurse.

- [ ] "Can we check for any medical issues/pain?"

- [ ] "Do you think a medication can help with their sundowning?"

- [ ] "Can we check for a UTI?"
