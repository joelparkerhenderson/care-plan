Finding the right facility for a loved one can take some time. Try to give
yourself as much time as you can to choose the best facility for your loved
one’s situation. Doing so will likely ensure a much better match in the end.


## 1. Determine the level of care needed

**Assisted Living Facility (ALF):** This type of housing is designed for people
who need various levels of medical and personal care. Living spaces can be
individual rooms, apartments, or shared quarters. An ALF generally provides a
home-like setting and is physically designed to promote a resident’s
independence while also offering services that can assist with daily activities.

**Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF):** Most nursing homes today are skilled nursing
facilities and are licensed by the state and federal governments. They provide
skilled or rehabilitative care, have nursing aides and skilled nurses on hand 24
hours a day. Most people in nursing facilities are not ill enough to need
hospital care and are too ill to receive care at home or in an ALF. In addition
to providing round the clock medical care, SNFs are also commonly used for
short-term rehabilitative care.

**Memory Care:** Memory care is a form of senior living that provides specialized care
for people living with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.
Also, note care can be provided in something called Continuing Care Retirement
Communities (CCRCs). If your loved one is concerned about future care, a CCRC may be
a good option for them.

**Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC):** A Continuing Care Retirement
Community (CCRC) allows individuals to age in place while receiving the care
they need. A typical CCRC has three “living components” - independent living,
assisted living, and skilled nursing. Most communities charge a substantial
entry fee and require residents to pay a monthly maintenance or service fee. It
guarantees the resident a bed in the ALF and SNF when they need it, though does
not provide home care to residents in independent living units (that would need
to be privately organized). Very importantly, most CCRCs do not accept residents
with an existing physical or cognitive impairment.


## 2. Consider the setting

Accepting that an illness, injury or the natural effect of aging necessitates
needing help and leaving home (and the safety it brings) can be very difficult.
To help reduce the anxiety or sadness a move like this can create, consider
where your loved one would want to be.

* Living downtown or in the suburbs?

* Living in the same city where they currently live or elsewhere?

* Living close to family in another location?

* Does the home need to accommodate pets or a special diet.


## 3. Assess your ability to pay

Long-term care is expensive. You will need to establish a budget and how you will pay
for care. If your loved one has long-term care insurance, it can help cover the cost of
care. If there is no long-term care insurance or financial resources to cover the cost of
care, it may limit the care options available.


## 4. Visit prospective facilities²

Internet research, referrals and word of mouth can only get you so far. To know
whether a facility is the right one for you and your loved one, you will need to pay it a
visit. When you do, consider the following areas.

General:

- [ ] Can my loved one's needs be met? Be explicit about what the person requires. Don't hold anything back.

- [ ] What is the ratio of caregivers to residents? It should be no less than 1 to 15 for assisted living and 1 to 8 for memory care.

- [ ] What conditions would cause a resident to need to move to another level of care?

- [ ] What doctors and other care providers make regular visits to the facility?

Meet residents:

- [ ] Ask residents if they like living there.

- [ ] Ask any of their friends or family who might be visiting what they think about the facility.

- [ ] Are the residents in common areas engaged in activities? Or are they in
their rooms or sitting on their own?

- [ ] How are the residents' interactions with each other?

- [ ] How are the residents' interactions with the staff?

Meet staff:

- [ ] Are they friendly with you and the residents?

- [ ] Do they greet you, smile, and make eye contact?

- [ ] How do they get a resident’s attention?

- [ ] Are they active on the floor or congregated in a nursing station?

- [ ] Do they seem to know the residents such as what they want and like?

Activities:

- [ ] Can residents to bring some of their own furniture and belongings to personalize their space?

Security:

- [ ] What are the community fees, such as a one-time payment that covers the administrative cost of moving someone into the facility and refurbishing a room for that person?

- [ ] What fees are refundable if your loved one doesn't want to stay?
