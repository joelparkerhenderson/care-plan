# Hire help

Hire help if you want, and if you can afford it, for example:

- [ ] Hire a lawyer who has experience with care plans and/or elder law and/or estate planning.

- [ ] Hire a social worker who can work with the person, and with the caregivers, to advise about social support, social services, care placements, and more.

- [ ] Hire an accountant who can manage the finances, ideally including taxes, insurance, payments, bank accounts, benefits disbursements, retirement planning, liquidation of assets, and more.
   
- [ ] Hire a therapist for your person, and potentially for yourself as well, to help with areas such as dementia, depression, disability, family systems, end-of-life planning, etc.
