Some important areas to ask about: insurance, payments, taxes, retirement plans, bank accounts, benefits disbursements, pensions, government programs such as United States Social Security, inheritances, and asset management especially if there's a risk of large medical bills.

- [ ] Hire a therapist for your person, and potentially for yourself as well, to help with areas such as dementia, depression, disability, family systems, end-of-life planning, etc. Some important areas to ask about: grief, anger, fear, family-wide challenges, and Internal Family Systems (IFS).

- [ ] Hire a social-governmental advisor who can work with the person, and with the caregivers, to advise about social support, social services, care placements, and more.

- [ ] Hire a caregiver on an as-needed basis who can assist the person, and assist the caregivers, with simple needs such as shopping, reading mail, watching television, video calling friends and family, etc. This person can be akin to a babysitter, or akin to a personal assistant. The purpose is to help the person, and take some of the load off the other caregivers, and to give feedback to the other caregivers about what the person may be wanting or needing.
