# Legal care setup

Do the steps here that you want:

- [ ] Hire a lawyer who has experience with care plans and/or elder law and/or estate planning.

- [ ] Create a will.

- [ ] Create a "Durable Power Of Attorney" (DPOA). This is a legal document that the person signs, that enables other people to care for the person. For example, a lawyer can create a DPOA that authorizes a person's adult childern to care for the person. Any DPOA has many options, such as for medical care, financial care, etc. so you may want to read about DPOAs then discuss the options with the person, the lawyer, and your other involved caregivers. For us, we created a DPOA that includes all the adult children, and empowers them to act independently, because we wanted all the adult children to be able to help with care.

- [ ] Have the lawyer create original documents with blue ink wet pen signatures, because this works the best in practice. Have the lawyer keep originals in the the lawyer's safe, and provide each of the relevant caregivers with a notarized certified official copy.

- [ ] If any providers have received older legal information, such as a previous version of a will, or an outdated advanced care directive, or a superseded version of a DPOA, then it's very important to update these providers with the new legal documentation.

Safekeeping:

- [ ] When we receive significant legal documents, such as an original birth certificate, or a doctor's testimony letter intended to approve benefits, then we take the documents to the lawyer for safekeeping. 

- [ ] We have the lawyer created a certified notarized copy for each of the adult children to keep with their own records.
