# Final arrangements

- [ ] Document where to find the will.
 
- [ ] Document who is the executor and how to contact them.
 
- [ ] Document what the person wants for final arrangements, such as a burial, or cremation, or a service, or a memorial, etc.
 
- [ ] Document what the person wants for final events, such as a guest reception, or friends gathering, or social wake, or sitting shiva.

- [ ] Document any specifics such as which site/church/temple/etc., which readings/psalms/passages/songs, which officiants/priests/rabbis/imams/etc., which volunteers/speakers/pallbearers, which vendors/musicians/photographers, which guests should be invited and how to contact them.

- [ ] Make arrangements while the person is alive. This is because some providers offer discounts if the arrangements are made ahead of time, and also because some jurisdictions use different legal semantics when arrangements are ahead of time.

- [ ] Ask the person if they want any kind of outreach to anyone now, to ask for help, or to give advice, or to be involved.

- [ ] Ask the person if they want to write their own obituary. For some people, this can be deeply meaningful.
