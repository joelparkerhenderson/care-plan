When a person is experiencing dementia, they may have symptoms such as repeating phrases, or expressing confusion, or feeling sundowning, or making accusations. Here are some things you can tyr.


## Repeating

For example, the person is repeating words or phrases.

What to Say:

1. Nothing.

2. Answer if it is a question.

3. Replace the repeating with a different repeated pattern (like a familiar song).


## Confusion

For example, the person is confused and says "I want to go home".

What to Say:

1. Ask "What do you need at home?"

2. Keep asking questions about home until you find the unmet need.


## Sundowning

Sundowning is when a person experiencing dementia feels upset in the evening.

What to Do:

1. Take them outside 1 hour before sundowning.

2. Give them something to do with their hands during peak sundowning time.


## Accusations

For example, the person is accusing you or someone else of something.

What to Say:

1. Don't defend yourself or show evidence/use logic.
   
2. Speak to the feelings behind the accusation.

3. Give space if needed to cool off and then offer to help.
