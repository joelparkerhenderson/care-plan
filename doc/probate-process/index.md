Probate is the legal process that takes place after someone dies that determines how the deceased’s assets will be distributed.

In most circumstances, the executor named in the will assumes the role of handling probate. If there's no will, the state probate court will decide the rules of inheritance.

Keep in mind that the probate process and timeline will vary depending on the state but, in general, probate law requires these steps.


## Step 1: File a petition to begin probate.

- [ ] File a request in the county where the deceased person lived at the time of their death.

The paperwork will ask for you to be officially acknowledged as the legal executor representing the estate. In addition to the petition, you’ll need to file a valid will, if one exists, and the death certificate.

- [ ] Wait for the court will schedule a hearing to approve the executor (or hear objections from other parties).

If you’re approved as executor, the court will officially open the probate case and you will now be able to act on behalf of the deceased’s estate.


## Step 2: Give notice.


- [ ] Mail a notice that the estate is in probate to all creditors, beneficiaries and heirs (as required by the court).

- [ ] Publish a notice in the newspaper. This is a requirement in some jurisdictions.


## Step 3: Inventory assets.

Collect, inventory and appraise all assets that are subject to probate and present them to the court, such as:

- [ ] Bank accounts.

- [ ] Retirement accounts.

- [ ] Stocks and bonds.

- [ ] Real estate.

- [ ] Personal effects, such as valuable art, jewelry, collectibles.


## Step 4: Handle bills and debts.

- [ ] Collect money owed to the estate, such as outstanding paychecks and rents.

- [ ] Review any outstanding bills and debts and decide whether/how they must be paid. This may require some sleuthing on your part. You might need to go through checkbooks, emails and/or bank account to gather information. You'll need to ensure the estate's assets can cover all debts before paying them. If not, the state will prioritize creditor claims.

- [ ] Pay all applicable taxes.

- [ ] File a final income tax return on the estate.

- [ ] Set up an estate account for paying the estate's final bills and expenses. This is not a requirement, yet it's usually a good idea.


## Step 5: Distribute remaining assets.

- [ ] Give the remaining property to the rightful heirs and/or as the will directs.


## Step 6: Close the estate.

- [ ] Submit receipts and records of everything to the court.

- [ ] Ask the court for the estate to be closed.

- [ ] Ask the court for the executor to be released from the role.
