# Right to die

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_die)

The right to die is a concept based on the opinion that human beings are entitled to end their lives.

The term "right to die" has been interpreted in many ways, including issues of suicide, passive euthanasia, active euthanasia, assisted suicide, and physician-assisted suicide.

This is especially important for a person with a terminal illness, or in incurable pain.

The question of who, if anyone, may be empowered to make this decision is often the subject of debate.

Some forms of voluntary euthanasia are legal in some countries, such as Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, and Switzerland.

## United States

The United States Patient Self-Determination Act does permit elderly Medicare/Medicaid patients (and by implication, all "terminal" patients) to prepare an advance directive in which they elect or choose to refuse life-extending and/or life-saving treatments as a means of shortening their lives and thus suffering unto certain death.

Some U.S. states have passed laws related to right to die, and to physician-assisted suicide. Some examples are the
California End of Life Option Act, Hawaii Our Care Our Choice Act, and Oregon Death with Dignity Act.
