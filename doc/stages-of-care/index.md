your loved one about their current needs and future preferences for care. Listen
attentively to their concerns and wishes, and involve them in decision-making
whenever possible.

- [ ] **Gather documents.** Begin assembling vital health and legal documents,
such as advance directives, living wills, and durable power of attorney for
healthcare. These documents will provide guidance in the event of a medical
crisis and ensure that your loved one's wishes are respected.

caregiving, considering factors such as your family dynamics, career
responsibilities, and personal commitments. Balancing these aspects of your life
is crucial for maintaining a sustainable caregiving strategy.

healthcare professionals who can offer guidance, assistance, and emotional
support. Don't hesitate to reach out for help when needed, as caregiving is not
a journey you have to navigate alone.

document, a designated personal representative document, and power of attorney
document. Get advice from a legal pro on drafting and executing.

from a financial pro for long-term planning.

your own mental health. Seek support from a therapist or counselor if needed,
especially one who understands the dynamics of caregiving and professional
stress.
