# Certificate of disposition of remains

Upon the signing of the death certificate, local authorities will typically issue a certificate of disposition of remains, also known as a burial or cremation permit.

Crematories and cemeteries require this form before they will cremate or bury a body. In some jurisdictions, the form is combined with a transportation permit that allows the movement or shipment of a body.
