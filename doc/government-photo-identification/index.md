# Government photo identification

Government photo identification is often necessary for a person to access more services, such as banking, healthcare, and the like.

- [ ] Ensure the person has an official government photo id. Example: in the United States, the typical official government photo id is a U.S. passport, or a U.S. state driver's license, or a U.S. non-driver's license.

- [ ] If the person is unsafe to drive, and has a driver's license, then cancel the driver's license, and if possible replace it with a non-driver's license.

- [ ] If the id has a choice to do additional processes, such as automatic sign up for voter registration, or automatic sign up for organ donor registration, then decide on these.
 
- [ ] If there's any possibility that the person may ever need to take a flight, then ensure the person has a valid government passport. We suggest ensuring the passport has at least one more year of validity, because of the long timeline to reissue a passport, and because some passport checkpoints require a minimum number of months remaining. Ask your government passport office for specifics.

United States specifics:

- [ ] Get a United States government REAL ID. The rules for REAL ID are evolving, and in the future a REAL ID may become a requirement for flights, even domestic flights.
