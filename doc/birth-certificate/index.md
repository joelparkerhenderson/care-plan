# Birth certificate
  
- [ ] Ensure the person has an original birth certificate. This is because you'll very likely need this for what's coming.
 
- [ ] If needed, request an original birth certificate from the person's birthplace. If the birth certificate provider offers multiple kinds of birth certificates, such as "short form" and "long form", then request the "long form" version because it contains more information, and also is a requirement for some kinds of government processes, such as obtaining a United States passsort. Be advised the request may take 1-3 months to be filled.
