Government interactions can be complex for a person who is elderly, or ill, or needs care.

- [ ] Ensure the person has a current government photo id, such as a driver's license, non-driver's photo identification card, or travel passport. If the id is expiring soon, then make arrangements ahead of time to renew it.

- [ ] File any relevant paperwork with government agencies, such as to claim benefits, request social services, and report disabilities.

- [ ] File for any disability markers, such as a government handicapped parking placard.
 
- [ ] File for any service animal needs, such as a government veterinary approval license.
