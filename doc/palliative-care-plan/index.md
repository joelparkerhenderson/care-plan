## Palliative care options

Palliative care has a variety of options for where it happens, and these are detailed below:

* Palliative care at home

* Palliative care at a care home

* Palliative care at a day facility

* Palliative care at a hospital


### Palliative care at home

Palliative care at home enables a person to remain in their own home. Palliative nurses will move into the home of the person they’re responsible for looking after to provide round-the-clock support. A trained palliative carer can also pay home visits at arranged times of the day and even overnight. Home care visits can be used to provide breaks for family members or other carers, or to assist with personal care or continence care, for example.

### Palliative care at a care home

Some care homes will be able to provide you with palliative care if they have the right staff. For those who already live in a care home, remaining there to receive care is a more comfortable option than having to move to a hospital ward. It’s widely considered to be a calmer environment in which to receive the medical support required. Not all residential care homes can provide palliative care, though – only those with specially trained staff.

### Palliative care at a day facility

Palliative care at a day facility is when the palliative nursing and rehabilitation is provided in a day facility. A person doesn’t have to reside there permanently – they can attend for the day then return home. You may be required to schedule your visits in advance, depending on the particular hospice’s policy. This is also known as respite care, and helps the primary caregivers take a break; this support helps caregivers avoid burnout and provide care more efficiently.

### Palliative care at a hospital

Hospitals provide short-term palliative care until a discharge plan is in place. palliative care in hospitals is often delivered over a short-term period. Depending on your condition and your needs, your support will either be overseen by specialist teams or a single nurse. Palliative care teams in hospitals will monitor discharge plans and arrange for individuals to be transferred to receive palliative care in hospices, care homes or in their own home.
