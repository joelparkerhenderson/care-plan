# Vision disability

Most important:

- [ ] Encourage the person to work on changing their habits now, so that the person isn't faced with both the terribleness of losing eyesight and the stress of learning new habits.

- [ ] Ensure the person has a way to take notes that they can later access. This may be as simple as buying a bigger darker thicker pen, or getting a small pendant voice recorder.

- [ ] Talk with your person about any nightmares. Not too many people know that losing your eyesight is often followed by nightmares. Talking about the eyesight-nightmare correlation may help reduce the nightmares.

- [ ] Try learning Braille. For some people, learning Braille is viable, even as an older adult. Braille opens up a new way of reading, both for paper reading and for electronic braille terminal reading.	

Big print:

- [ ] Ask all the person's providers, such as utilities, hospitals, banks, etc. if the provider has a way to switch from normal-size print to large-size print for correspondence, prescriptions, bills, etc.

- [ ] Try big print books, which are available in some bookstores such as by special order, or available online at many booksellers.

Assistive technology:

- [ ] Configure your person's phone to use assistive technologies. For example, iPhones and Android phones have ways to use voice control, such as by saying "Hey Siri" or "OK Google". iPhone also have a feature called VoiceOver that lets you use your phone without looking. Goo

- [ ] Try an e-book reader, such as a Kindle or Kobo, where the user can make the font size bigger.

- [ ] Try Amazon Echo and related voice-interface products, which features speech capabilties, and can be easier for some people to use than their phones for simple tasks such as looking something up on the internet, playing music, or video calling.

- [ ] Try a computer screen reader. Anecdotally, Microsoft Windows has a tendency to move things around for no good reason, which interferes with the person's muscle memory of how to open this or that program. Consider macOS or Linux instead of Windows.

- [ ] Try audio books and podcasts. For example, consider the Audible.com audio books service. If you are technical, you may want to learn about how to convert EPUB/MOBI books with Calibre to DOCX, put them in a shared folder, then use a screen reader to hear them.
