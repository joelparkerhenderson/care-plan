## Create the plan

Make goals:

* Make goals that are designed to improve the individual's health, well-being, and quality of life.

* For example, a goal could be "Take one lap of the garden or house during the care visit to help build mobility and core strength. Work toward increasing to two laps within two months."

If you wish, you can try using SMART criteria:

[] Specific: target one area clearly and precisely.
[] Measurable: quantify progress toward success by using metrics.
[] Actionable: ready to start and possible to accomplish.
[] Relevant: connected to what's being done, considered, and/or resourced.
[] Timely: occurring at a favorable or useful time and opportune.

1. Conduct an initial assessment: The first step in creating a care plan is to conduct an initial assessment of the elderly person's needs - including a comprehensive evaluation of their physical, emotional, and social needs. This assessment may involve reviewing their medical history, conducting a physical examination, and talking to the individual and their family members.

2. Develop a care plan: Once this initial assessment is complete, the next step is to develop a care plan that addresses each of the elderly person's specific current needs accordingly. The plan should be tailored to the individual's preferences (including down to personal things like how they like their tea, or where they keep their walking stick!) and should take into account any medical conditions or limitations with every step.


2. Determine what's needed: Determine the types of services, treatments, and tasks that are needed to achieve the goals. This may include assistance with daily activities, medication management, physical therapy, and social activities such as local get-togethers with friends, or video-calls with loved ones, or exercising at the park, etc.

3. Develop a schedule: Once the types of services are identified, it’s time to develop a schedule for providing these services. This should take into account the individual's preferences and should be flexible enough to accommodate changes in their health or schedule. It should also be well within the capacity of your care team to provide, without running the risk of late or missed visits because of travel or scheduling issues!

4. Regularly review and adjust the care plan: Review the plan and outcomes to ensure the plan still meeting the individual's needs. Adjustments may need to be made to the plan based on changes in the individual's health, preferences, or other factors. Regular assessments should be conducted to monitor the care recipients, progress and to make any necessary adjustments to the care plan.

## Misc

Help with personal responsibilities, medication delivery, and general physical, mental and psycho-social issues.  For some families, a home health aide or an assisted living environment addresses these issues.

Anticipate changes needed in living arrangements developed to ensure the continued safety and health of the aging individual.  Sometimes, simple attention to geriatric home safety is all that a family needs to ensure the continued health and safety of their loved one.  Other times it may be necessary for the older individual to be moved to a smaller housing unit, apartment or other one-level living arrangement (including assisted living options and/or nursing homes).

Managing the connections between support services, healthcare providers and the aging individual to ensure that the loved one receives the necessary care and monitoring.

A plan for ongoing monitoring and reassessment.  Families, especially those who don’t live nearby their aging parents, should make sure that they receive periodic reports about their loved ones.  Regular reassessments should be scheduled to address any changes in the older person’s physical, mental or psycho-social needs.  Special attention should be paid to the need for immediate modification in the event of a drastic change in the older person’s health.
