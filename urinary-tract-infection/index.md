# Urinary tract infection (UTI)

A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of the urinary system. The urinary system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. 

Most infections involve the lower urinary tract â€” the bladder and the urethra. If an infection is limited to the lower bladder, it can be painful and annoying. But serious health problems can result if a UTI spreads to the kidneys.

Health care providers often treat urinary tract infections with antibiotics. You can also take steps to lower the chance of getting a UTI in the first place.

Check with your healthcare provider about any potential UTI. We prepared for talking with  healthcare providers by reading this writeup about UTIs and treatments: [link](https://westessexccg.nhs.uk/your-health/medicines-optimisation-and-pharmacy/clinical-guidelines-and-prescribing-formularies/05-infections/2514-antibiotic-prophylaxis-guidelines-for-recurrent-urinary-tract-infections-in-adults/file)

If the person has a UTI, or symptoms of a UTI, or a health incident that is correlated with getting a UTI, then here is the care plan we are currently using.

Before treatment:

- [ ] If possible before treatment with antibiotics, acquire mid-stream urine (MSU) sample, and send for culture, to confirm infection and/or inform treatment.

Start precautionary/preventative treatment:

- [ ] Start preventative antibiotic treatment. We prefer to use the antibiotic amoxicillin because it's very common, very well-understood, inexpensive, and tends to work well for my loved one. You may prefer to use a different antibiotic; ideally choose an antibiotic according to previous known sensitivities and choosing the narrowest spectrum agent available.


- [ ] Take supplementary cranberry pills. Evidence for efficacy is mixed or unclear. My  opinion is it's worth doing because cranberry pills are easy, cheap, and work well for my mom.

- [ ] Test UTI symptoms i.e. fever, chills, dysuria, nocturia, confusion, abdominal pain, and presence of bacteria via UTI test strips. Do for 3 days.

- [ ] Hydrate. We prefer using herbal tea, such as mint tea, parsley tea, and chamomile tea; these kinds of tea have evidence that they help prevent UTIs and help reduce the severity of UTIs.

If any of the UTI tests are positive and/or any of the UTI symptoms happen, then:

- [ ] Self-start antibiotic therapy with a 3-day dose. We prefer to use the antibiotic amoxicillin because it's very common, well-understood, inexpensive, and tends to work well for my loved one. You may prefer to use a different antibiotic; ideally choose an antibiotic according to previous known sensitivities and choosing the narrowest spectrum agent available.

If symptoms worsen or are not resolved within 72 hours of self-start antibiotic therapy:

- [ ] Take the person to a doctor for evaluation and treatment.
