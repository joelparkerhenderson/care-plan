### United States Social Security

Social Security is a U.S. federal program that administers retirement, disability, survivor, and family benefits, and enrolls individuals in Medicare, and provides Social Security Numbers, which are unique identifiers needed to work, handle financial transactions, and determine eligibility for certain government services.

- [ ] Ensure the person has a Social Security number. This is necessary for many other services, such as getting a U.S. bank account.

- [ ] Ensure the person has an original Social Security card. This is helpful for many other services, such as proving the person's identity at a government agency.

- [ ] Ensure the person is receiving Social Security benefits, if possible. Most U.S. elderly citizen residents are entitled to these benefits. Some people have alternatives, such as U.S. California teachers union members for some years, who received California managed pension plans instead of U.S. Social Security.

- [ ] Help the person sign up at the official website of the Social Security Administration, which is [SSA.gov](https://ssa.gov). The website can verify benefits, show itemized billing, generate printable cards, and more.
