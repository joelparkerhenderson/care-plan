# Out-of-wallet questions

Out-of-wallet (OOW) questions are security challenges that help identify a person.

For example:

* A website may challenge you with the question "What is the name of your first pet?"

* A social network may prompt you with "Which of these people do you know?"

* A bank may challenge you with "Which of these four streets are near where you have you lived?"

The purpose of out-of-wallet questions is to provide organizations with a quick easy way to check if a person is who they say they are.

The term "out-of-wallet" is because the creators wanted a way to identify a person even after the person's wallet was stolen, and also wanted a way to block a thief who stole a wallet.


## Dementia and out-of-wallet questions

Dementia causes problems for out-of-wallet questions, because a person with dementia might be unable to recall or recognize the correct answers, and a caregiver might not know the answers.

Many out-of-wallet questions rely on older historical information, such as past residences, past employers, and past friends. Some out-of-wallet questions are deliberate trick questions that require the person to answer "none of the above".

Therefore, if you are at risk of dementia, or a caregiver for someone with dementia:

- [ ] Ask the person's bank and financial institutions about how to handle out-of-wallet questions when a person has dementia. Specifically, ask for the organization's policy for when a person is unable to recall or recognize answers.

- [ ] Ask the person's websites and social network sites about any out-of-wallet questions, and how to handle these when a person has dementia.
    
- [ ] Document any out-of-wallet questions and answers that you encounter.

- [ ] Document previous employers, such as a company's name and address.

- [ ] Document previous residences, such as a home's postal addresses

- [ ] Document previous phone numbers, such as an old home phone number that's no longer in use.
