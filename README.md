# Care Plan

A care plan is a way to help a person ensure continued good health.

This document is a free open source care plan template. Our family is creating and using this template for our elderly parents who have Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and cancer.

## What is the goal of a care plan?

The goal of a care plan is to help a person thrive:

* Improve the person's quality of life, health, and wellness.

* Support the person's independence and abilities for daily life tasks.

* Mitigate the person's risks of hospitalization or institutionalization.

* Create mutual understanding among a person's family members, friends, and providers.

* Help each participant have a better understanding of their role and responsibilities.


## Care for yourself too

Be aware that care is challenging:

* Parents may not cooperate or understand. That gets really hard and can burn people out.

* Children may not cooperate or understand. That gets really complex and can interfere with care.

* Providers may not be what you expect. That gets really confusing and can cause mistakes and errors.
