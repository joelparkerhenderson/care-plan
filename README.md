# Care Plan

A care plan is a way to help a person ensure continued good health.

This document is a free open source care plan template. Our family is creating and using this template for our elderly parents who have Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and cancer.

## What is the goal of a care plan?

The goal of a care plan is to help a person thrive:

- [ ] Improve the person's quality of life, health, and wellness.

- [ ] Support the person's independence and abilities for daily life tasks.

- [ ] Mitigate the person's risks of hospitalization or institutionalization.

- [ ] Create mutual understanding among a person's family members, friends, and providers.

- [ ] Help each participant have a better understanding of their role and responsibilities.


## Care for yourself too

Be aware that care is challenging:

* Parents may not cooperate or understand. That gets really hard and can burn people out.

* Children may not cooperate or understand. That gets really complex and can interfere with care.

* Providers may not be what you expect. That gets really confusing and can cause mistakes and errors.


## Care plan checklist


### Visit in person when you're able

Look for any health-related changes for example:

- [ ] Physical changes such as mobility, balance, tremor.

- [ ] Mental changes such as cognition, memory, mood, fatigue.

- [ ] Senorial changes such as vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch.

- [ ] Hygenic changes such as cleanliness, odor, hair/skin/nails.

- [ ] Medical changes such as indicators of pain, numbness, infection.

Ask caregivers what else is needed for example:

- [ ] Any supply needs, such as food, clothes, toiletries, bedding, etc.?

- [ ] Any treatment needs, such as for prescriptions or medications?

- [ ] Any other needs, issues, and recommendations?


### Hire help if desired

Hire help if you want, and if you can afford it, for example:

- [ ] Hire a lawyer who has experience with care plans and/or elder law and/or estate planning.

- [ ] Hire a social worker who can work with the person, and with the caregivers, to advise about social support, social services, care placements, and more.

- [ ] Hire an accountant who can manage the finances, ideally including taxes, insurance, payments, bank accounts, benefits disbursements, retirement planning, and more.
   
- [ ] Hire a therapist for your person, and potentially for yourself as well, to help with areas such as dementia, depression, disability, family systems, end-of-life planning, etc.


### General medical checkups per year

Do any general checkups.

* This can be with the person's primary physicians.

* This can be for a typical yearly physical exam, such as with a checkup of vision, hearing, balance, pulse, blood pressure, iron levels, nutrient levels, hormone levels, etc.

Handle issues, for example:

- [ ] Ensure all results reach all the right people, such as care providers.

- [ ] Follow through with prescriptions, treatments, and recommendations.

- [ ] Set up any subsequent appointments, referrals, tests, and payments.

- [ ] Follow up as indicated by the providers.


### Specialist medical checkups per year

Do any specialist checkups.

* This can be with the person's referral physicians.

* This can be for any significant medical conditions, such as for cardiovascular issues, gastrointestinal issues, gerontological issues, mobility issues, neurological issues, etc.

Handle issues, for example:

- [ ] Ensure all providers are in communication about results and plans.

- [ ] Arrange exchanges among providers as needed, then verify the success.

- [ ] Obtain copies of outputs, such as diagnostic images and treatment plans.

- [ ] Follow up as indicated by the providers.


### Dental checkups per year

Do a shallow cleaning.

* This can be with the person's primary dentist, or hygenist, or oral surgeon, etc.

Handle issues, for example:

- [ ] Fill a cavity.

- [ ] Cast a crown.

- [ ] Deep clean a quadrant.

- [ ] Debride a plaque.

- [ ] Provide a new toothbrush and floss.

- [ ] Follow up as indicated by the providers.


### Monthly affairs

Update affairs each month, for example:

- [ ] Balance all checkbooks.

- [ ] Do any receivables and payables.

- [ ] Field all providers' requests.

- [ ] Claim all benefits.

- [ ] Ensure all transactions are as expected.

- [ ] Verify all insurance is current and as expected.

Handle issues, for example:

- [ ] Update any incorrect records.

- [ ] File all government tax forms.

- [ ] Report any transaction discrepancies.

- [ ] Refer as needed to a professional such as an accountant.


### Annual affairs

Update affairs each year, for example:

- [ ] Pay annual taxes.

- [ ] Review affairs to ensure expected activities and rule out unexpected activities.

- [ ] Ensure identifications and credentials are sufficient.

- [ ] Update any year-based items, such as automobile registration,

- [ ] Request any new benefits, such as age-related discounts, or retirement-related benefits.

Handle issues, for example:

- [ ] Update all contact information.

- [ ] Obtain any needed identifications and credentials

- [ ] Refresh any expired identifications and credentials

- [ ] Report anything that appears to be lost or missing.

- [ ] Review all ongoing debits, services, and contracts.

- [ ] Sunset any unwanted accounts and services.

- [ ] Refer as needed to a professional such as a lawyer.


### Government setup - as desired

- [ ] Ensure the person has a current government photo id, such as a driver's license, non-driver's photo identification card, or travel passport. If the id is expiring soon, then make arrangements ahead of time to renew it.

- [ ] File any relevant paperwork with government agencies, such as to claim benefits, request social services, and report disabilities.

- [ ] File for any disability markers, such as a government handicapped parking placard.
  
- [ ] File for any service animal needs, such as a government veterinary approval license.


### Medical setup - as desired

- [ ] Configure the emergency contact information on the person's phone.

- [ ] File any care limit plans, such as advanced directives.

- [ ] File a living will.

- [ ] File a "do not resuscitate" (DNR) order.

- [ ] File any organ donation plans.

- [ ] Obtain a medical id bracelet.


### Legal setup - as desired

- [ ] Hire a lawyer who has experience with care plans and/or elder law and/or estate planning.

- [ ] Create a will.

- [ ] Create a "Durable Power Of Attorney" (DPOA). This is a legal document that the person signs, that enables other people to care for the person. For example, a lawyer can create a DPOA that authorizes a person's adult childern to care for the person. Any DPOA has many options, such as for medical care, financial care, etc. so you may want to read about DPOAs then discuss the options with the person, the lawyer, and your other involved caregivers.

- [ ] Have the lawyer create original documents with blue ink wet pen signatures, because this works the best in practice. Have the lawyer keep originals in the the lawyer's safe, and provide each of the relevant caregivers with a notarized certified official copy.

- [ ] If any providers have received older legal information, such as a previous version of a will, or an outdated advanced care directive, or a superseded version of a DPOA, then it's very important to update these providers with the new legal documentation.


### Final arrangements

- [ ] Document what the person wants for final arrangements, such as a burial, or cremation, or a service, or a memorial, etc.

- [ ] Document any specifics such as which site/church/temple/etc., which readings/psalms/passages/songs, which officiants/priests/rabbis/imams/etc., and which guests should be invited.

- [ ] Make arrangements while the person is alive, and document them. This is because some providers offer discounts if the arrangements are made ahead of time, and also because some jurisdictions use different legal semantics when arrangements are ahead of time.

- [ ] Ask the person if they want to write their own obituary. For some people, this can be deeply meaningful. 


### Specifics for the United States

- [ ] Ensure the person has a current government photo id, such as a U.S. state driver's license, or a U.S. state non-driver photo id, or a U.S. passport.

- [ ] Ensure the person has Medicare, including Medicare Plan A, Medicare Plan B, and a Medicare supplementary insurance plan. Help the person sign up with Medicare.gov.

- [ ] Ensure the person has Social Security, including an original Social Security card, and all applicable benefits. Help the person sign up with SSA.gov.

- [ ] If the person is eligible for Veterans Affairs (VA), then ensure the person has VA care, benefits, records, current credentials, and so on.
   
- [ ] Ensure the person has an original birth certificate, because you'll very likely need this for what's coming. If needed, request an original birth certificate from the person's birth state. If the birth state offers multiple kinds of birth certificates, such as "short form" and "long form", then request the "long form" version because it contains more information and is necessary for some kinds of U.S. government processes. Be advised the request may take 1-3 months to be filled.
