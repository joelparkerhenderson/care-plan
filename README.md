# Care Plan

A care plan is a way to help a person ensure continued good health.

This document is a free open source care plan template. Our family is creating and using this template for our elderly parents who have Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and cancer.

## What is the goal of a care plan?

The goal of a care plan is to help a person thrive:

* Improve the person's quality of life, health, and wellness.

* Support the person's independence and abilities for daily life tasks.

* Mitigate the person's risks of hospitalization or institutionalization.

* Create mutual understanding among a person's family members, friends, and providers.

* Help each participant have a better understanding of their role and responsibilities.


## Care for yourself too

Be aware that care is challenging:

* Parents may not cooperate or understand. That gets really hard and can burn people out.

* Children may not cooperate or understand. That gets really complex and can interfere with care.

* Providers may not be what you expect. That gets really confusing and can cause mistakes and errors.

### Healthy Habits

Every day, try to be healthy:

- [ ] Daily exercise. Ideally aerobic (e.g. walking) and strength (e.g. weights).

- [ ] Good nutrition. Ideally leafy greens, vitamins, antioxidants, omega 3.

- [ ] Good sleep. Ideally with a sleep monitor. Fix any snoring or sleep apnea.

- [ ] Social involvement. Ideally in-person groups plus video calls.


### Visit in person when you're able

Look for any health-related changes for example:

- [ ] Physical changes such as mobility, balance, tremor.

- [ ] Mental changes such as cognition, memory, mood, fatigue.

- [ ] Sensorial changes such as vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch.

- [ ] Hygenic changes such as cleanliness, odor, hair/skin/nails.

- [ ] Medical changes such as indicators of pain, numbness, infection.

Ask caregivers what else is needed for example:

- [ ] Any supply needs, such as food, clothes, toiletries, bedding, etc.?

- [ ] Any treatment needs, such as for prescriptions or medications?

- [ ] Any other needs, issues, and recommendations?


### Help brighten days

Help the person brighten their days with happy memories and experiences, for example:

- [ ] Help the person get photos they like. Photos help brighten up a room, and also can help the person with memory areas. Depending on the person's physical capabilities, consider printing photos on soft mattes and paper, rather than using hard frames and glass.

- [ ] Help the person get music they like. Music helps improve mood, and also can help the person with cognition areas. Depending on the person's capabilities and preferences, consider making a music playlist, or CD, or cassette tape, or even a physical LP with a physical record player.

- [ ] Help the person get videos they like. Videos help improve mode, and also can help the person with memory, cognition, and narrative. Consider making personal videos, where loved ones talk to the person. Consider getting videos of family events. If you have older videos such as VHS tapes or DVDs, then consider transferring the content to videos that the person can play on their phone, or computer, or smart TV.


### Hire help if desired

Hire help if you want, and if you can afford it, for example:

- [ ] Hire a lawyer who has experience with care plans and/or elder law and/or estate planning.

- [ ] Hire a social worker who can work with the person, and with the caregivers, to advise about social support, social services, care placements, and more.

- [ ] Hire an accountant who can manage the finances, ideally including taxes, insurance, payments, bank accounts, benefits disbursements, retirement planning, liquidation of assets, and more.
   
- [ ] Hire a therapist for your person, and potentially for yourself as well, to help with areas such as dementia, depression, disability, family systems, end-of-life planning, etc.
